The House Sales (RealAgents) project aims to predict house sale prices using historical data. It involves cleaning and analyzing datasets, building machine learning models (e.g., RandomForest, LinearRegression), and evaluating their performance. The goal is to optimize listing prices, reduce time to sale, and provide actionable insights for RealAgents.
